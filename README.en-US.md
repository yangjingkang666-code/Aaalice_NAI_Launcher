## What can it do?

NAI Launcher is built for people who use NovelAI regularly: generate images, refine prompts, save references, find inspiration, and manage finished work in one application.

### 🎨 Create

- **Generation and editing**: text-to-image, image-to-image, Inpaint, Focused Inpaint, Outpaint, and upscale/enhance workflows.
- **References and characters**: Vibe Transfer, Precise Reference, multi-character prompts, reference images, and independent negative prompts.
- **Prompt workspace**: tag autocomplete, weight syntax, token counts, pinned words, random tag libraries, and prompt import/export.
- **Style Lab**: offline random artist chains, configurable style mutations, same-seed A/B comparisons, and on-demand generation with project favorites.
- **Reviewable Prompt optimization**: generated results persist structured semantic entries; one “Organize with AI” action classifies unknown phrases and supplies Chinese reading translations while local tags and manual edits stay authoritative.
- **Knowledge / Prompt RAG**: the semantic workbench searches project vocabulary, the bundled tag catalog, and the Chinese dictionary; DanbooruSearch is tried only when local sources have no match. Candidates are applied one by one and every retrieval input is kept as Recipe evidence.
- **Safe edits and batch planning**: the Prompt Patch workbench protects identity, parameters, and references and offers explicit reuse/random/specified seed behavior; AI batch planning proposes tasks only, which enter the serial queue after per-item review.

### 🗂️ Organize

- **Local gallery**: scan local artwork, search Prompts and metadata, organize categories, favorites, and collections, and perform batch operations.
- **Project workspaces**: optionally keep `images/`, image sidecars, Recipes, and project vocabulary together in a selected folder; legacy gallery files and Recipes can be imported without overwriting existing project files, and switching projects re-indexes by path.
- **Generation queue**: submit batches, pause/resume, reorder, handle failures, and track progress.
- **Reproducible queue tasks**: an implicit random seed is resolved once at queue admission and reused after retries or restarts.
- **Image details**: inspect generation parameters, positive/negative prompts, and character prompts; copy selected content back to the generator or tag library.
- **Statistics**: review creation habits by size, sampler, time, and Anlas usage.

### 🌐 Explore

- **Online galleries**: search Danbooru, Safebooru, Gelbooru, AI TAG, and Codex Gallery (NovelAI QuickTagCloud).
- **Source filters**: search, favorites, date/rankings, content ratings, blacklist, and output filters as provided by each source.
- **Libraries and references**: manage personal tags, pinned words, Vibe resources, and Precise Reference resources.

### 🤝 Connect

- **Agent Chat**: use the generation sidebar or mobile drawer to search tags, organize Prompts, inspect history, and prepare generations; every operation that may consume Anlas requires separate confirmation.
- **Optional local Agent control API**: after explicit opt-in, DeepSeek Harness and other local Agents can read status, send prompts, abort a run, and plan offline Style Lab experiments over loopback; the Launcher still owns the token, permission prompts, and Anlas audit. See [`plugins/deepseek-harness/README.md`](plugins/deepseek-harness/README.md).
- **Image reverse-prompt evidence**: optionally run JoyTag and WD EVA02 sequentially as local evidence before the configured image model integrates the result; failures remain auditable and never start generation automatically.
- **Desktop integrations**: connect Krita Bridge and local ComfyUI workflows to your existing tools.
- **Sync and backup**: manually push and pull selected data through GitHub or WebDAV; credentials and NovelAI Tokens are excluded from backups.

## Platform support

| Platform | Current status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Windows** | Primary development and release platform | Suited to long sessions, batch generation, and Krita / ComfyUI integration. Installer and portable packages are available. |
| **macOS** | Available and still being refined | Portable package available. If macOS blocks an unnotarized build, allow it in the system security prompt. |
| **Android** | Beta | Supports phones, landscape layouts, tablets, and large screens, with mobile entry points for generation, galleries, libraries, queues, and settings. |
| **Linux** | No official release package | Not currently a supported download target. |

## Download and first steps

### 1. Download

Download the package for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Aaalice233/Aaalice_NAI_Launcher/releases/latest). Every release also includes `checksums.txt`, which can help diagnose a damaged download or installation failure.

| Platform | File | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | `NAI_Launcher_Windows_<version>_Setup.exe` | Installer package, recommended for most users. |
| Windows | `NAI_Launcher_Windows_<version>_Portable.zip` | Portable package; extract and run without installing. |
| macOS | `NAI_Launcher_macOS_<version>_Portable.zip` | Extract and open `Aaalice NAI Launcher.app`. |
| Android | `NAI_Launcher_Android_<version>.apk` | Sideload the APK; the first installation may require permission to install unknown apps. |

### 2. Sign in to NovelAI

You can sign in with NovelAI credentials or a **Persistent API Token**. If web security verification prevents password login, Persistent API Token is the more reliable option. Local galleries, libraries, resource libraries, and settings can be used without signing in; generation, Vibe encoding, cloud upscale, and other online operations require authentication.

### 3. Set up your workflow

- **Local gallery**: choose artwork folders in Settings, then open the gallery to start scanning. Scanning is performed on demand rather than immediately on application startup.
- **Project workspace**: under **Settings → Data & Storage**, choose or create a project directory. Use Import when you want to copy legacy images and Recipes; existing project files are never overwritten. Close the project to return to the legacy global image folder.
- **Autocomplete**: the base tag catalog is included and works offline. Related-tag recommendations, the Chinese tag dictionary, and AI translation are optional data sources managed under **Settings → Data Sources & Cache**.
- **Krita**: enable Krita Bridge in Launcher Settings, then follow [`krita_plugin/README.md`](krita_plugin/README.md) to install the plugin.
- **ComfyUI**: configure the local ComfyUI address and workflow under **Settings → Integrations**. Models and nodes remain managed by your ComfyUI environment.

## Data and privacy

NAI Launcher does not host your account or artwork on a project-operated server. Different features send data to different services:

| Feature in use | Recipient |
| --- | --- |
| Generation, image-to-image, editing, Vibe encoding | NovelAI, including the relevant Prompt, parameters, and reference/source images. |
| Online gallery search and downloads | The third-party gallery you selected; availability, rate limits, and content rules belong to each site. |
| AI translation or Agent Chat | The model service you configured; conversations, attached images, and tool results needed for the task may incur service charges. |
| Image reverse prompting | Only the image you explicitly select is sent to your configured vision model; JoyTag/WD EVA02 tag inference stays local. |
| Sync and backup | The GitHub or WebDAV storage you configured; only the data categories you explicitly select are uploaded. |

- NovelAI Tokens, WebDAV passwords, and GitHub Tokens are stored in the device secure store and are not included in backups.
- Local Prompts, gallery indexes, tags, and Agent sessions are stored on the device by default; Agent web tools are off by default.
- The external Agent control API is off by default; when enabled it listens only on loopback, and its application-support descriptor contains a bearer token that must not be shared or committed.
- Online galleries contain third-party content. Rating filters do not replace user judgment; follow source-site rules, local laws, and NovelAI's terms of service.
- WebDAV security depends on the server and transport you configure. Confirm that the server is trusted and keep important local backups before syncing.
